# Crossroads - JavaScript Routes #

**IMPORTANT: API isn't totally defined yet, some features may be added/removed and methods/properties renamed.**



## Introduction ##

Crossroads.js is a routing system that isn't strictly related with the URL, location.hash and/or server requests. 
The idea is to process any kind of string input and dispatch events if it matches any of the desired patterns.

Crossroads shouldn't depend on any existing library or framework besides [JS-Signals](http://millermedeiros.github.com/js-signals/) 
(used for event dispatching), it should be a pluggable piece of code that can be used on many different kinds of projects, 
be it for a server-side or client-side application.

It should be *robust* and as flexible as possible while still being simple to use.



## Dependencies ##

**This library requires [JS-Signals](http://millermedeiros.github.com/js-signals/) to work.**
