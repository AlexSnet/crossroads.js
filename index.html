						<strong>Crossroads.js</strong> is a routing library inspired by URL Route/Dispatch utilities present on 
						frameworks like Rails, Pyramid, Django, CodeIgniter, etc... It parses a string input and  decides which 
						action should be executed by matching the string against multiple patterns.
					</p>
					<p>
						If used properly it can reduce code complexity by avoiding tightly coupling objects and also by abstracting navigation paths.

					<h2 class="h2-1">Why?</h2>
					<p>
						JavaScript applications are becoming bigger and more complex each day and it is hard to keep control 
						of what should be loaded/executed at each section.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of the back-end frameworks already provide some sort of routes or URL dispatch system but it usually requires 
						a strict structure that limits the flexibility of the code, specially since it is directly related with the server request 
						and calling actions on specific kinds of classes/objects.
					</p>
					<p>
						Crossroads.js was built with flexibility in mind and with the goal to be used as a standalone utility which can be plugged 
						into any application and/or other libraries and frameworks to allow easy and robust URL dispatch.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the main differences of Crossroads.js is that it uses plain strings for the routing system which means it can be 
						used to route URLs, server requests or simply as a messaging system across your application. It also means that 
						Crossroads.js don't do things that it isn't supposed to do like updating the window.location, loading data or changing 
						the application state unless you want to.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>A routes system shouldn't do anythings else besides routing.</strong>
					</p>
					<hr />
					
					<h2 class="h2-1">Why isn't it a plugin for one of the famous JS Libraries/Frameworks?</h2>
					<p>
						Extending a library to do things it isn't supposed to do and that are not directly related with its core goal defeats 
						the Single Responsibility Principle and is considered a bad practice besides its broad use.
					</p>
					<p>
						DOM manipulation libraries should be used only for manipulating the DOM. Routing libraries shouldn't do anything 
						besides routing... <em>- A duck can walk, fly and swim, but he doesn't do any of those things properly...</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Another reason for not extending an existing library/framework is that the amount of code reused would be so minimal 
						that it doesn't pay-off the flexibility loss. <strong>It means that you can use Crossroads.js with "any" other library/framework.</strong>
					</p>
					<hr />
					
					<h2 class="h2-1">Dependencies</h2>
					<p>
						The only dependency is <a href="http://millermedeiros.github.com/js-signals/">JS-Signals</a> which is used for the event 
						system to allow greater flexibility and also to provide advanced features that wouldn't be available with simple callbacks. 
						It can be used together with any existing JavaScript library/framework.
					</p>
					<hr />
					
					<h2 class="h2-1">Should I use it for every kind of project?</h2>
					<p>
						Certainly not. If your project have just a few static pages a simple switch statement may be enough to solve your 
						problems, but as applications start to grow and you have a slightly more complicated flow, having a system that supports 
						dynamic variable parsing and a flexible validation schema may help you to reduce the overhead of doing those things manually.
					</p>
					<p>
						I consider the main target to be single page applications with complex navigation paths and also large websites that shares 
						the same JS files across multiple pages or would benefit from this kind of approach.
					</p>

						Crossroads.js comes in two different flavors, a regular JS file that creates a variable called crossroads on the global 
						scope or an AMD module, which doesn’t generate any global variables. Both versions shares exactly the same code base the 
						only thing that differs from both is the way that the code is wrapped for deployment.

					<h3 class="h3-1 code" id="crossroads-add_route">crossroads.addRoute(<em>pattern, handler, priority</em>)</h3>
					<p>Creates a new route pattern listener and add it to crossroads routes collection.</p>
					<h4 class="h4-1">Parameters</h4>
					<dl class="doc">
						<dt>pattern<em>:String</em></dt>
							<dd>String pattern that should be used to match against requests. 
								Pattern can contain named variables surrounded by `{}` that will be evaluated 
								and passed to handlers as parameters.
							</dd>
						<dt>handler<em>:Function (optional)</em></dt>
							<dd>Function that should be executed when a request matches the Route pattern.</dd>
						<dt>priority<em>:Number (optional)</em></dt>
							<dd>Route execution priority. Routes with higher priority will be tested before. 
								It is important to note that crossroads will stop pattern match test as soon as 
								it finds a Route that matches the request. Setting the priority is a way to invert 
								“natural” test order. Routes are tested by order of creation if priority is omitted.
							</dd>
					</dl>
					<h4 class="h4-1">Return</h4>
					<p>
						<code>addRoute</code> returns a <code>Route</code> object.
					</p>
					<h4 class="h4-1">Example</h4>
<pre class="brush: js; gutter:false; toolbar:false">
//match '/news/123' passing 123 as param to handler
var myRoute = crossroads.addRoute('/news/{id}', function(id){
  alert(id);
});
